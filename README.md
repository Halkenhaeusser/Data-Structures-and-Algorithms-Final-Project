# Next Steps
* Wir muessen vor jedem code chuck im Markdown documenten (sagt Hannah).
    * nicht zu viele sachen printen und inline comments sind nur fuer uns. 
* Which politician(s) do we want?
* which similarity measure should we use? 
* What's the targeted code architecture?
* Who does what? (Johannes' suggestion)
    * Write an Email to Simon to discusss project generally
    * Lukas: get twitter data, save and process it, for one MP from each party?
    * Johannes: Code functions for similarity (maybe not all of them haha)
    * Carlo: Documentation and explanation of the similarity measures
